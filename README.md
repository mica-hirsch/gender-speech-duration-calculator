# gender-speech-duration-calculator
This tool uses InaSpeechSegmenter and a few more tools to calculate the percentage of time of female voice speech and male voice speech in a video/movie.
Although we acknowledge there are many more genders than male/female, and that there is no such thing as a "woman's voice" or a "man's voice", this tool tries its best to make a contribution to make gender inequality more visible. Hopefully in the future there will be more developed tools that fight gender inequality for all genders.
